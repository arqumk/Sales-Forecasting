# Sales Forecasting System: Transforming Data into Actionable Insights
 
## Project Overview
A leading U.S.-based iron casting manufacturer needed better sales forecasts. Their goal was clear: improve forecasting accuracy to make smarter business decisions. I delivered a tailored, data-driven solution that transformed how they approached sales predictions.

## Key Challenges
1. Sales data was unorganized and required extensive preprocessing.
2. Ensuring forecasting accuracy to support critical business decisions.
3. They needed an automated solution that could integrate seamlessly into their existing workflows.
   
## Solution
a) Built an efficient, automated pipeline to clean and preprocess sales data from an Oracle database. 
b) Trained multiple regression models using scikit-learn and selected the most accurate one, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 20%. 
c) Developed a bash script to automate the retraining process every three months, keeping the forecasts up-to-date.

## Results
i. Reduced forecasting errors with a MAPE of less than 20%. 
ii. Improved inventory management and streamlined production scheduling, saving time and costs. 
iii. Executives received timely insights for confident decision-making.
